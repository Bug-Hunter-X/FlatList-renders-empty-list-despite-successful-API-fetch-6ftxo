# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The bug is caused by improper error handling or an asynchronous operation that doesn't update the component state correctly.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` component fetches data from a sample API endpoint. Despite the successful API call and data retrieval, the FlatList remains empty. This is likely due to asynchronous operations and incorrect state management.

## Solution

The solution involves careful asynchronous operation handling and thorough error management. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the component, ensuring the FlatList correctly renders the fetched data.
